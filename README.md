2. Discrete Cosine Transform <br>

> The DCT is in a class of mathematical operations that includes the well known Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), as well as many others. The basic purpose of these operations is to take a signal and transform it from one type of representation to another. For example, an image is a two-dimensional signal that is perceived by the human visual system. The DCT can be used to convert the signal (spatial information) into numeric data ("frequency" or "spectral" information) so that the imageâ€™s information exists in a quantitative form that can be manipulated for compression.<br>
